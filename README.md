### Nowadays I Heavily Use

**Coding Stack:** Vue.js, Bun.js, esbuild, C++.<br>
**Codeium AI:** Free GitHub Copilot alternative.<br>
**Gemini:** Best at explaining, comparing or suggesting modern code but sometimes hallucinates. For that reason having to use GPT-4 alongside. Google is constantly updating Gemini, maybe fixed in upcoming v1.5 with 1 million tokens. Can't wait.<br>
**Stable Diffusion XL:** Creating character art with LoRAs in Kaggle (Google Colab alternative). Good they offer free GPU.<br>
**Raindrop:** Bookmark manager with thumbnail previews.

### Hobbies

Only 2, coding and music. A playlist with 700+ curated music which I've been collecting for 5 years. YouTube playlist is troublesome to maintain. Sometimes channels delete or private their video and YouTube hides them without telling the title of it. Wrote a [script](https://github.com/rakibdev/dotfiles/blob/main/home/rakib/Downloads/apps-script/youtube-playlist-export/app.js) for this which exports videos details in JSON so I can search and re-add.
